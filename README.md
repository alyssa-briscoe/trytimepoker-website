**TryTimePoker's Static Website**

This project was created for a freelance client, Twitch Streamer TryTimePoker. He needed a simple website for his viewers to find his links and stream as well as discoverability through search engines.

At first, I used HTML and CSS to design the basic website. I got the idea to add an embed of his live stream onto the website but wanted to present it in an elegant way, instead of just embedding it to the bottom of the page. I used basic HTML/vanilla JavaScript to initially set this up however, I found it lacking. I set up Bootstrap 5 and created an invisible modal that would appear and start the stream upon clicking the watch button. I used JavaScript to remove the modal when closed and refresh the page so the watch button could be used many times as well as the sound cutting off when needed. I hosted the page on Google Firebase as well as pushed changes when needed. I added SEO/discoverability to the page and registered it under the Google Search Console. 

Overall, I got to practice HTML, CSS, JS and other skills like git, search engine optimization and discoverability, web hosting (Firebase) and custom domain set up. I learned practical uses for Bootstrap 5 as well as creating modals both through data attributes and JavaScript. In the future, I will use JavaScript alone to create Bootstrap 5 components and customize the content, as it appears to be cleaner with greater options and possibilities.
